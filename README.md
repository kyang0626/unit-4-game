# Crystal Collector

1. This project is a game made to implement jquery concepts.

   At the very beginning, the computer chooses random number. The player then clicks a picture to get a random number.
   The player must get a total score equal to the random number chosen by the computer to get a win.
   If the player goes over a total score of more than the random number, then its a point added to his losses.
